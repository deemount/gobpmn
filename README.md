# gobpmn

## What it is?

gobpmn is a project for Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) and written in Go. What was a small attempt in the beginning has now grown so much that I decided to distribute this project in several repositories for a better overview and handling. gobpmn does not claim to be complete, but I am motivated enough to try to achieve this goal anyway.

gobpmn is also a library for elements and attributes from the OMG specification for BPMN and is orientated towards this, as well as the Camunda Modeller in version 7.

gobpmn is also an experimental laboratory for testing new techniques in Go and can be seen as a Sandbox. By distributing the modules to repositories, we now have a completely new environment for testing certain features. This also allows me to deepen my own expertise in Go.

## What it is not?

gobpmn is definitely not (yet) a commercial project and does not claim to be.

## Participate

You are very welcome to contribute to this project if you feel called to do so. Of course, I would also be happy if you let me know if you want to take a line code or two from gobpmn for your own project, workflow engine or library. Feel free to take what you need.
